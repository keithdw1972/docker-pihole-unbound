# docker-pihole-unbound

### Use Docker to run [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net) with an upstream [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) resolver.

### This repo references noth chriscrowe's (https://github.com/chriscrowe/docker-pihole-unbound) and MathewVance's https://github.com/MatthewVance/unbound-docker existing repos, but is being modified to fit my needs. Thanks to both for their excellent work.
